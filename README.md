## Problem Statements and Solutions

### 1. Identifying Sales Trends
- **Problem**: Understanding overall sales trends, including total sales and average sales per outlet, was challenging.
- **Solution**: I created a dynamic dashboard that aggregates total sales data and visualizes it across outlets, product categories, and outlet types. 

### 2. Evaluating Product Performance
- **Problem**: Blinkit offers a wide range of products. Pinpointing high-performing categories was essential.
- **Solution**: Using pivot tables and charts, I analyzed product types like **Fruits and Vegetables** and **Snack Foods** to reveal their contribution to total sales.

### 3. Outlet-Specific Performance
- **Problem**: Outlets vary in size and location, impacting their sales. Analyzing performance at these levels was necessary.
- **Solution**: The dashboard highlights performance across **Outlet Size** (High, Medium, Small) and **Outlet Location** (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3), helping identify areas for improvement.

### 4. Customer Insights
- **Problem**: Customer ratings and preferences impact repeat purchases and brand loyalty.
- **Solution**: Added a section displaying **average ratings** and their correlation with sales to enhance customer satisfaction strategies.
